HTTP support for the twilight ecosystem.

## Examples

There are a few usage examples located in the [root of the `twilight`
repository][github examples link].

## Features

### Decompression

The `decompression` feature enables brotli decompression support via the [`brotli`] crate.

This is enabled by default.

### Deserialization

`twilight-http` supports [`serde_json`] and [`simd-json`] for deserializing
responses.

#### `simd-json`

The `simd-json` feature enables [`simd-json`] support to use simd features
of modern cpus to deserialize responses faster. It is not enabled by
default.

To use this feature you need to also add these lines to
`<project root>/.cargo/config`:

```toml
[build]
rustflags = ["-C", "target-cpu=native"]
```

You can also set the environment variable
`RUSTFLAGS="-C target-cpu=native"`. If you enable both `serde_json` and
`simd-json` at the same time, then `simd-json` will be used.

To enable `simd-json`, do something like this in your `Cargo.toml`:

```toml
[dependencies]
twilight-http = { default-features = false, features = ["rustls-native-roots", "simd-json"], version = "0.2" }
```

### TLS

**Note**: not enabling any TLS feature is supported for use behind a proxy;
Discord's API is HTTPS only.

`twilight-http` has features to enable HTTPS connectivity with [`hyper`]. These
features are mutually exclusive. `rustls-native-roots` is enabled by default.

#### `native`

The `native` feature uses a HTTPS connector provided by [`hyper-tls`].

To enable `native`, do something like this in your `Cargo.toml`:

```toml
[dependencies]
twilight-http = { default-features = false, features = ["native"], version = "0.2" }
```

#### `rustls-native-roots`

The `rustls-native-roots` feature uses a HTTPS connector provided by [`hyper-rustls`], which uses
[`rustls`] as the TLS backend, and enables its `native-tokio` feature, which uses [`rustls-native-certs`]
for root certificates.

This is enabled by default.

#### `rustls-webpki-roots`

The `rustls-webpki-roots` feature uses a HTTPS connector provided by [`hyper-rustls`], which uses
[`rustls`] as the TLS backend, and enables its `webpki-tokio` feature, which uses [`webpki-roots`]
for root certificates.

This should be preferred over `rustls-native-roots` in Docker containers based on `scratch`.

### Trust-DNS

The `trust-dns` enables [`hyper-trust-dns`], which replaces the default
`GaiResolver` in [`hyper`]. [`hyper-trust-dns`] instead provides a fully
async DNS resolver on the application level.
